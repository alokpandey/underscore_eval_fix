# Git Repository Instructions

## Setting up the Remote Repository

To add the remote repository and push your code, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub, GitLab, or your preferred Git hosting service named "underscore_eval_fix"

2. Add the remote repository to your local Git configuration:
   ```
   git remote add origin <REMOTE_URL>
   ```
   Replace `<REMOTE_URL>` with the URL of your repository, for example:
   - HTTPS: `https://github.com/yourusername/underscore_eval_fix.git`
   - SSH: `git@github.com:yourusername/underscore_eval_fix.git`

3. Push your code to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```
